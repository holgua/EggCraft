EggCraft: A Sparrow Framework Demo Project
================================================

What is EggCraft?
-----------------

EggCraft is a microscopically small demo game based on the Sparrow Framework.

It's purpose is to show the basic setup and some abilities of the Sparrow Framework within a deliberately small scope. It is neither a complete guide to Sparrow, nor does it utilize all the frameworks functionality.

In the game the player has to catch falling sparrow eggs with a basket. Touch and move the basket to catch the eggs.

Have fun!
